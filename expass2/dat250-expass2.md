# Lab Report
## Techinical Issue 
### Installation
No issue was encountered during the installation.
### JPA Coding
#### -Stack overflow upon assertThat() returns False
When the code line 75 in the MainTest.Java is executed, the program determines that the elements don't match, thus creating an error message by calling the toString() method. However, I used Lombok to auto-generate toString() method and since the CreditCard class the Bank Class has a bidirectional mapping, this toString() method creates an infinite loop.
The issue is firstly solved by writing my own toString() method and later by passing the test, thus not calling the toString() method in the first place.
#### -Bank's card set doesn't match the expected value
When the code line 75 in the MainTest.Java is executed, the program determines that the elements don't match. A toString() call reveals both sets (the tested set is the bank's card set and the expected set is the set of two credit cards) have the same elements.
Further inspection shows the issue lies within the mapping. By removing the instruction "targetEntity" after the "@ManyToOne" in the CreditCard class, the issue is sold in the end.
## Data Inspection
Upon Passing the test run, the Database View of the IntelliJ IDE was used to verify the database structure. By comparing the diagram generated by IntelliJ, with the diagram shown in the assignment, the mapping relationship of different classes are indeed correct.
