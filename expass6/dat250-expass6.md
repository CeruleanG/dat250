## Experiment 1: Model-View-Controller Web Applications
No technical problems were met during the completion of the tutorial.

## Experiment 2: Single-page applications - Updated
~~I was not able to fully complete the task. I was able to undestand how to implement CRUD https but wasn't able to make it work with the application.~~

After having some more time to watch tutorials and working on the assignment, I was able to understand how to implement CRUD https, create methods and bind them to the clicks on the buttons.

In order to test the application I used a db json database. To start it, use the following command : json-server --watch db.json Then start the application.
