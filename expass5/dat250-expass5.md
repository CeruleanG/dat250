# Lab Report
## Technical Issues
### Experiment 1
When the program was run firstly, it shows that the port I was using (8080) was occupied. 
Consequently, I had to specify which port to use for the program. 
In the "application.properties" in the resources folder, I wrote "server.port=9090". Then the program runs without issue.

### Experiement 2
Same issue as the experiement 1, but this time I had to use "curl http://localhost:9090" for it to work instead.

### Experiment 3
No issue

### Experiment 4 
No issue
