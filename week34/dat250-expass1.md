## technical issues
#### "mvn" is not recognized as an external command
After Maven has been installed, I ran into an issue when I typed the command "mvn -v" in cmd console.
The issue was solved by realizing that I haved downloaded the source version of Maven rather than the binary version. After the correct installation and a reboot, the work was back to track.

## validation of the installation
#### Java SE
This part is verified by using the command "java -version" and version info are correctly displayed.
#### Maven
This part is verified by using the command "mvn -v" and version info are correctly displayed.
#### git
This part is not verified by commands but rather the fact that Heroku are able to use it successfully.
#### Heroku
This part is verified by using the command "heroku login" and it can log into my account successfully.
#### Postgres
This part is not verified as I cannot yet see how it is involved in the heroku tutorial.

## technical issues when using Heroku
Thankfully everything ran as the tutorial stated and nothing bugged

## pending issues
#### edit file using windows command line
I had to use the notepad to edit system file as the command "edit" doesn't seem to work.
